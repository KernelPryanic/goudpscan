# **goudpscan**

‚ö° A pretty fast UDP scanner. ‚ö°

## Install

You can install the latest version of `goudpscan` by running the following command:

```sh
go install github.com/KernelPryanic/goudpscan@latest
```

This will install the `goudpscan` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To scan ports in verbose mode (listening for ICMP packets; default mode unless `-f` for fast scan is specified), you need to run the binary with super privileges. You can set the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability on the binary to execute the verbose scan without super privileges if you are on Linux üêß:

```sh
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep $(which goudpscan)
```

To install it system-wide, you can run the following command from the root of the repository:
```sh
./install.sh
```
This script sets the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability automatically.

## Build

```sh
go build -o bin/goudpscan
```

## Test

```sh
sudo go test -cover ./...
```

`sudo` is required in order to create a raw socket for the ICMP listener.

## How to use

```sh
sudo goudpscan -f -t 1 -c 975 -p 7,19-22 -s 127.0.0-32.0/24 127.1.0.1
```

If `CAP_NET_RAW` capability is set, you can run the binary without super privileges.

```sh
goudpscan -f -t 1 -c 975 -p 7,19-22 -s 127.0.0-32.0/24
```
